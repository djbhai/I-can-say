*For each component,explain what kind of technique used and why use that?
*That is, which feature of that technique you think meet your requirments or why not others.

plan/lifecycle: waterfall

requirment: from the view of users. 
            from the view of programmer.(button, translation model, NN model)
	    maybe Consistency, Completeness, and Correctness

design: 1.system python, javascripts(due to api), MVC,CSS, how the components in requierement connected
	remember:traceability: which design meets which requirment
	2.architecture, UML,how many parts, how each part connectes, how UI looks like 

Process and Management : Github, what, why(features).

code: class, exception, thread

test: static checking, unit test- how many units in the design. test cases
        how test cases meet requirement and traceability.
        code coverage
	test cases can be splits into several components instead of just one waterfall.	

Maintenance : traceability.
